WEEK-4 MODULES HOMEWORK


1 - Random Password


As a user, I want to use a program which can generate random password and display the result on user interface. So that I can generate my password for any application.


Acceptance Criteria:


Password length must be 10 characters long. It must contain at least 2 upper case letter, 2 digits and 2 special symbols. You must import some required modules or packages. The GUI of program must contain at least a button and a label. The result should be display on the password label when the user click the generate button. (use import random, string and tkinter)

	

2 - The Least Common Multiple


As a user, I want to use a program which can calculate the least common multiple (L.C.M.) of four numbers. So that I can find the least common multiple (L.C.M.) of my inputs.


Acceptance Criteria:


Ask user to enter the four numbers. Use try/except blocks to verify input entries and warn the user for Nan or non numerical inputs. Calculate the least common multiple (L.C.M.) of four numbers Use gcd function in module of math (use import gcd function in math)



3- Number Guessing Game


As a player, I want to play a game which I can guess a number the computer chooses in the range I chose. So that I can try to find the correct number which was selected by computer.


Acceptance Criteria:


Computer must randomly pick an integer from user selected a range, i.e., from A to B, where A and B belong to Integer. Your program should prompt the user for guesses if the user guesses incorrectly, it should print whether the guess is too high or too low. If the user guesses correctly, the program should print total time and total number of guesses. You must import some required modules or packages You can assume that the user will enter valid input. (use import random and time)



4- Mis Calculator


As a user, I want to use a program which can calculate basic mathematical operations. So that I can add, subtract, multiply or divide my inputs.


Acceptance Criteria:


The calculator must support the Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division operations. Define four functions in four files for each of them, with two float numbers as parameters. To calculate the answer, use math.ceil() and get the next integer value greater than the result Create a menu using the print command with the respective options and take an input choice from the user. Using if/elif statements for cases and call the appropriate functions. Use try/except blocks to verify input entries and warn the user for incorrect inputs. Ask user if calculate numbers again. To implement this, take the input from user Y or N. (use import sys, ceil function in math)
